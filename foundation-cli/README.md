iPlant Agave API Command Line Interface (CLI)
===================================================

This project contains a set of Bash Shell scripts to interact with the iPlant Agave API. The CLI contains tools for streamlining common interactions with the API and automating repetative and/or background tasks. Conventions adopted in this project follow below.


Requirements
=================

The following technologies are required to use the Agave API cli tools. 

	* bash
	* curl
	* Perl
	* Python (including json.tool)	
	
Installation
=================

Just clone the repository from Bitbucket and add the bin directory to your classpath and you're ready to go.

	> git clone https://bitbucket.org/taccaci/foundation-cli.git
	> export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/foundation-cli/bin

Usage
====================

All commands follow a common syntax and share many of the same flags `-h` for help, `-d` for debug mode, `-v` for verbose output, `-V` for very verbose (prints curl command), and `-i` for interactive mode. Additionaly, individual commands will have their own options specific to their functionality. The general syntax all commands follow is:

	<command> [-hdv]
	<command> [-hdv] [target]
	<command> [-hdv] [options] [target]
	
Each command has built in help documentation that will be displayed when the `-h` flag is specified. The help documentation will list the actions, options, and targets available for that command.

Authentication with the API is done via OAuth2. The CLI will handle the authentication flow for you. Simply run the `auth-tokens-create` command and supply your client key, secret, and username & password and a bearer token will be retrieved from the auth service. Alternatively, you can specify a bearer token at the command line by providing the `-z` or `--access_token` option. If you would like to store a token for repeated use so you don't have to keep reauthenticating with every call, run the `auth-tokens-create` script with the `-S` option to store the token locally for future use.
