Overview
--------
In January 2014, version 2 of the iPlant-developed [Agave API](http://agaveapi.co/) was released, bringing with it some powerful new features including:
* diverse execution paradigms including HPC, command-line, Condor, and Docker containers
* support for MyProxy-based authentication
* the ability to enroll your own computing and storage resources
* notifications via sophisticated callbacks
* job dependencies
* automated, asychronous data staging
* online support tools for app creation
* live documentation

We have assembled this software development kit with an eye towards developers affiliated with the iPlant Collaborative who are developing scientific applications for use by other users via the graphical Discovery Environment workbench, third party workbench systems, or personal integrations with the Agave SaaS API. With a little tweaking, 90% of the documentation here is generally applicable to using Agave in your own organization.
